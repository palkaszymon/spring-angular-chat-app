# Spring Angular Chat

The app is available [here](http://ec2-3-75-180-240.eu-central-1.compute.amazonaws.com) - until 31.01 (that's when my free tier expires on AWS, after that we'll see)

Project structure:
- src/main/java - Spring Boot backend source code
- frontend/src - Angular frontend source code
